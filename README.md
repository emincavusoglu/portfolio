# Clustering Analysis of World Countries
## Project Overview
### This project analyzes a dataset of world countries, focusing on various socio-economic indicators such as happiness, human development, ease of doing business, global competitiveness, corruption perceptions, economic freedom, and civil liberties. The analysis involved preprocessing the data, applying KNN imputation for handling missing values, and utilizing a clustering algorithm to identify patterns among countries.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following variables:

Country Name
Country - RegionId
Happiness
Human Development Report
Ease of Doing Business Score
Global Competitiveness Index
Corruption Perceptions Index
Index of Economic Freedom
Press Freedom Index
Political Rights Index
Civil Liberties Index
International Property Rights Index
Prosperity Index

## Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Used KNN imputer to fill missing values in the dataset.

## Clustering Analysis

Implemented a K-means clustering algorithm to classify countries based on the selected socio-economic indicators.
Visualized the resulting clusters, highlighting Turkey's position relative to other countries.

## Clusters Identified

Cluster 1: Countries with low socio-economic development indicators.
Cluster 2: Advanced countries with high levels of socio-economic development.
Cluster 3: Developing countries with moderate socio-economic indicators.
Cluster 4: Countries with larger economies and stronger property rights (Turkey is included in this cluster).
Cluster 5: Countries similar to Cluster 1, but with slightly better socio-economic indicators.

## Key Findings

Turkey's socio-economic indicators are lower than those of advanced countries in Cluster 2.
Significant differences were noted in areas such as political rights, civil liberties, corruption perceptions, and overall happiness.
Recommendations for Turkey
Strengthening Political Rights: Enhance political freedoms and ensure fair elections.
Promoting Civil Liberties: Protect freedoms of expression and assembly.
Combating Corruption: Implement measures to increase transparency and accountability.
Enhancing Well-being: Develop policies aimed at improving overall happiness and well-being.

## Visualizations

Included various visualizations, including maps showing the clustering of countries and comparisons of Turkey's statistics against other clusters.

## Conclusion

The cluster analysis provided valuable insights into the socio-economic characteristics of countries, allowing for a comparative assessment of Turkey's position. By addressing identified areas for improvement, Turkey can work towards enhancing its socio-economic development.
